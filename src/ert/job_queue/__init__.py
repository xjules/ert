# Getting LSF to work properly is quite painful. The situation
# is a mix of build complexity and LSF specific requirements:
#
#   1. The LSF libraries are accessed from the libjob_queue.so
#      library, but observe that the dependancy on the liblsf and
#      libbat libraries is through dlopen(), i.e. runtime. This module
#      will therefore load happily without access to the lsf libraries.
#
#      If you at a later stage create a lsf driver the runtime
#      environment must be able to locate the liblsf.so, libbat.so and
#      libnsl.so shared libraries, either through LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
#      other means.
#
#   2. To actually use LSF you need a whole list of environment
#      variables to be set: LSF_BINDIR , LSF_LIBDIR , XLDF_UIDDIR ,
#      LSF_SERVERDIR, LSF_ENVDIR - this is an LSF requirement and not
#      related to ERT or the Python bindings. The normal way to
#      achieve this is by sourcing a shell script.
#
#      If the environment variable LSF_HOME is set we set the
#      remaining LSF variables according to:
#
#           LSF_BINDIR    = $LSF_HOME/bin
#           LSF_LIBDIR    = $LSF_HOME/lib
#           XLSF_UIDDIR   = $LSF_HOME/lib/uid
#           LSF_SERVERDIR = $LSF_HOME/etc
#           LSF_ENVDIR    = $LSF_HOME/conf
#           PATH          = $PATH:$LSF_BINDIR
#
#      Observe that none of these variables are modified if they
#      already have a value, furthermore it should be observed that
#      the use of an LSF_HOME variable is something invented with ERT,
#      and not standard LSF approach.
